A sloppy WordPress powered Lifestream I cobbled together from a variety of long forgotten sources back in early 2007. I runs off RSS feeds and as most major sources have now either shut off access, killed or broken over time, it's time to share the source. Many things needed fixed over time that weren't, most noteably daylight savings time changes, but it was still a low maintainence script that still powers my http://www.gregorsmith.com site today, albeit with a lack of content.
